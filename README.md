o	What was the most challenging piece of this assignment?  Did you find it easy or challenging to work with HTML and CSS?  How long did this overall assignment take you?

The most challenging aspect was creating a responsive game board that maintained its grid structure and proper cell sizing across different screen sizes. Working with CSS Grid and Flexbox required careful planning to ensure the game boards displayed correctly while keeping ships, hits, and misses aligned. I found HTML relatively straightforward, but CSS required more trial and error. Perfecting the responsive design and styling details required additional time than setting up for the basic structure. It overall takes me 2 days to finish this assignment.

o	What decisions did you make when you made your site mobile friendly?

For optimization, I made the different sizes and font for display. As I would like my users can tell the difference and grasp the important information as soon as possible. Also, I tried to add some image to engage my users, letting them have a more vivid sense.

o	What did you take into account when you developed the design of your website?  Is there anything that you’re particularly proud of?

In developing the design, I focused on creating a modern naval warfare theme using a color palette of blues and grays that enhances readability while maintaining thematic consistency. I'm particularly proud of the game board's interactive elements, including the hover effects on cells and the smooth transitions when marking hits and misses. The use of CSS variables (custom properties) for colors and spacing makes the design system maintainable and consistent across all pages.

o	Given more time or resources, what additional features would you add to your site in the future? 

With more time, I would implement a drag-and-drop ship placement system to make the game setup more intuitive. Adding sound effects for hits and misses would enhance the gaming experience. Additionally, I would add animations for ship explosions and water splashes to make the game more visually engaging.

o	How many hours did you spend on this assignment? (Obviously doesn’t need to be 3 sentences)

Approximately 15 hours total.


o	(Optional) If you made any assumptions about this assignment, what are they?
N/A
